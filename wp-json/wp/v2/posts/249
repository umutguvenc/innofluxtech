They need to ensure their Data Organization has the capability to support it and this is achieved by undergoing Data Disruption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is&nbsp; Data Disruption?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data Disruption is a strategic and sharp transition from Current Data Organization to the Desired Organization, one which is more supportive of Mining and Analytics. Hence Data Disruption in the context of Data Management is centered on the acronym APE standing for Analyzing, Prioritizing, and Execution.&nbsp; In this article, along with Data Disruption APEs, we highlight DMM, Maturity Level, Road Map, and Change Management that allows organizations to become more data-driven.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"768\" height=\"352\" src=\"http:\/\/v2.saal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/blob1624873827674.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1563\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2019-03-21-at-12.58.45-PM-768x352.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.saal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/blob1624873827674.png 768w, https:\/\/www.saal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/blob1624873827674-300x138.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Figure 1: How Analysis, Prioritizing and Execution (APE) should be combined to achieve successful Data Disruption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very fundamental level, Data Disruption has to be backed by a business case which will clarify the need for Data Disruption and also will be instrumental in getting Budget Approvals and will continue to be the constitution until Data Disruption is achieved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the business case, Data Disruption starts with two key steps. They are<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyze the Current Data Organization<br>Analyze the Desired Data Organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analytical output from above leads to the architectural component Data Maturity Model (DMM) which defines traits of the desired data organization in terms of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data Governance:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defines key data organization roles such as Chief Data Officer, Data Stewards, Data Custodians, and Data Owners<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meta Data Management:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defines \u201cData about Data\u201d usually through standards such as Dublin Core Meta Data Properties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Master and Reference Data Management:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Identifying Data Silos, Data Exchange Patterns, Lineage, and Dependencies.<br>Defining a unified data platform, tools, technologies, and high-level architecture.<br>Data Quality Management<br>Define Tools, Technologies, and Strategy to enforce rules regarding Data Quality.<br>Data Security and Compliance<br>Define Tools, Technologies, and Strategy to achieve Data Security and Compliance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While defining Data Maturity Model, organizations also represent the Maturity Levels which determines the role of data in business activity. It differs from one organization to the other. Generally, there are five maturity levels an organization can use to grade itself and its business entities and lines of businesses as outlined in the table.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"768\" height=\"395\" src=\"http:\/\/v2.saal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/blob1624873862235.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1566\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2019-03-21-at-12.48.05-PM-768x395.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.saal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/blob1624873862235.png 768w, https:\/\/www.saal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/blob1624873862235-300x154.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Figure 2: Data Maturity Levels with Maturity Level 1 being lowest and 5 being highest<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the DMM and Maturity Levels are&nbsp;Analyzed, Road Maps can be&nbsp;Prioritized&nbsp;which will define the order and timeliness of changes that the organization needs to&nbsp;Execute.
