As per a report by PwC,&nbsp;pattern recognition&nbsp;can help discover whether patients may be at risk of developing a certain condition.&nbsp;[1]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another example of early detection can be seen in AI used in radiology providing more accurate images and suggested analysis enabling the radiologist to diagnose early and more accurately\u00a0which can help in providing timely treatment and better healthcare outcomes for the patient.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automating tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI can help in automating many functions within the clinical workflow in various healthcare settings as well as in the corporate healthcare domain. An example of this can be seen in pharmaceutical companies which leverage AI applications to automate many functions related to their drugs such as analysis, follow-up, and reporting. By automating administrative tasks and data-entry, AI helps clinicians dedicate more time for the patient.<br>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enhancing patient satisfaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI applications in healthcare aim to provide a better quality of care for patients, through a more effective patient journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c$150 billion in annual savings&nbsp;is the forecasted amount for the US healthcare economy as a direct result of clinical AI applications in healthcare by 2026\u2033<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per reports,&nbsp;AI can address 20% of unmet clinical demand. The top AI applications in healthcare include the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robot-assisted surgery<br>Virtual nursing assistants<br>Administrative workflow assistance<br>Fraud detection<br>Dosage error reduction<br>Connected machines<br>Clinical trial participant identifier<br>Preliminary diagnosis<br>Automated image diagnosis<br>Cybersecurity<br>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top 3 applications of AI in healthcare<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robot-Assisted Surgery<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Representing the greatest near-term value of up to $40 billion, as per Accenture analysis,&nbsp;robot-assisted surgery&nbsp;reduces the \u201clength of stay\u201d by 21%.&nbsp;By using data from previous surgical experiences, cognitive robots assist physicians in enhancing their technique and precision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtual Nursing Assistants<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtual nursing assistants help reduce long hospital visits, as they can keep track of patients\u2019 symptoms and alert physicians and clinicians when care is required.&nbsp;For nurses, this saves 20% of their time&nbsp;in \u201cunnecessary visits\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Administrative Workflow Assistance<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For doctors,&nbsp;administrative workflow assistance can save their work time up to 17% and 51% for nurses.&nbsp;[4]<br>AI can be very promising in the healthcare domain enabling a more patient-centric approach to care resulting in improved patient satisfaction and overall quality of care.<br>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to integrate AI into your business?&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/saal.ai\/contact\">Get in touch<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Insights<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Artificial intelligence is the talk of the century because it enables machines to act according to their previous learnings; in this way,&nbsp;machines can sense, react, comprehend information and act&nbsp;appropriately \u2013 faster and more accurately than humans.
