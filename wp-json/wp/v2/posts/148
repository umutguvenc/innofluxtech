With robots and the right piece of software, AI will not necessarily replace an academic organization\u2019s professors and lecturers, but instead, offer them a number of tools that will help them perform their work duties faster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can also help administrative workers do their work at a higher capacity by automating most office and accounting tasks. If you are in the business of developing smart software solutions for academic institutions, AI is your friend as machine learning offers the opportunity to develop a framework for creating your app or services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways in which AI can change education is by speeding up the administrative process for an institution and its educators. Grading homework, papers and evaluating student participation grades is a time-consuming task that requires a lot of time and effort from lecturers. The time they spend on these tasks could potentially be slashed with AI, allowing them to spend more time on lesson planning and having more one-on-one meetings with students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI-powered technology can already grade multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank tests without much of a hassle. Soon, you will be able to add software that can automate the process of grading written response work. AI can also help you streamline and improve the admissions process by cutting down the workload for high volume admissions offices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chatbots can help to automate the paperwork and support admission process for students, while interactive website materials can give prospective students an idea of what they can expect from an institution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your company&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.techemergence.com\/examples-of-artificial-intelligence-in-education\/\">can also create smart content<\/a>&nbsp;with AI, including digitized textbook guides and customizable learning digital interfaces for students of all levels. One solution you could implement is a platform that uses AI to help break down textbook content into digestible, bite-sized flashcards to create a smart study guide. This includes chapter summaries, multiple-choice practice tests, and true-false questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other solutions can help your students highlight and create text with personalized chapter-specific summaries, which are then archived into a digital collection that can be accessed online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.financialexpress.com\/education-2\/how-artificial-intelligence-is-impacting-education-positively\/1141801\/\">create smart, digital tutoring systems<\/a>&nbsp;that use cognitive science and AI technologies to offer personalized tutoring and real-time feedback for college students. This is especially useful for incoming college freshmen as they can use these tutors to avoid taking remedial courses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can help reduce an organization\u2019s costs of remedial learning, which is an expenditure that costs colleges $6.7 billion annually with only a 33% success rate in math courses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI offers a variety of solutions for businesses and educational institutions of all sizes, including machine learning technology and cognitive learning tools that can be used to develop personalized tutors and smart content.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The world of academia has been going through a technological revolution in the recent years and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is slated to change the landscape of education even further.
